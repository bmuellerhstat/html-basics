# HTML Basics
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using_ `HTML(Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.)` _elements in their proper syntax._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this repo:  

* `index.html` is where you will be doing your coding.
* `index.md` is just an example of how plain the **HTML Basics** look in markdown syntax.  You can ignore this file if you want to.
* `index.txt` is the raw code you will be copying/pasting into `index.html`.
  * NOTE: embedding `code` inside HTML is tricky. It often requires using 
  * `&lt;` instead of `<` and 
  * `&gt;` instead of `>`.
  * This has already been converted for you.
* `README.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html`.
* `style.css` is the styling that will make `index.html` look pretty.  You're welcome.

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* Little by little, start copying/pasting _small_ chunks of raw text from `index.txt` to `index.html` **INSIDE** here:
```  
    <div class="wrapper">
     
    </div>
```  
* Use the appropriate `HTML` syntax to format the code until the preview looks like `result.png`.
  * HINT: To make your `code` show up in red, surround it with the proper open/close `<code>` tags.
* Make sure you `add`/`commit`/`push`.  Then go into your repo's settings on github and change gh-pages to use the `master` branch.
* If you finish early, add a section to the bottom with links to helpful resources for learning more HTML Basics.

Good luck!
